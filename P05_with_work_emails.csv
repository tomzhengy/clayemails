Removed ambiguity in the legacy model that led to inconsistent usage of the data by defining clear product responsibilities.

You can try it out at www.paperlesspost.com/flyer\n\nI've also been leading the development team at an org level on adopting a modernized deployment flow for our React applications. While advocating for this change I wrote up a detailed proposal and gave multiple presentations, which included demonstrating working prototypes. Instead of building and deploying our javascript as part of the Rails server deploys, we have moved to a deploy system where we upload versioned static assets to S3 and reference them from the application server. This allows us to preview versions in production before activating them for our customers and dramatically speeds up the time it takes for us to deploy changes. This new deployment flow was a major factor in enabling us to build the Flyer MVP in a short time."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE_odMRXh7-LA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1720558774718/paperless_post_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=sNSWJ4liqPsWkh_dRaCbqHQJJJlGXbNNyjvwvHufft8"",""company_name"":""Paperless Post""},{""title"":""Senior Engineer"",""end_date"":""2016-05-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""NYC"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""The Yapp engineering team splits time between work on our consumer facing product and providing expert-level Ember.js consulting through its YappLabs arm.\n\nThrough YappLabs, I have consulted with over a dozen clients in the NYC area, helping their teams learn better Ember.js practices, performing code reviews, helping upgrade them from older versions, transitioning them to better app deployment strategies, as well as helping to build their products.\n\nYapp's internal product is built using Ember.js and Ruby on Rails with native Android and IOS apps using Cordova.

These “model services” are a system to export mongo’s replication logs to kafka and aggregate the updates in a stateful service to cache joins in redis. \n\nBuilt a read-only key-value store to deliver offline data to our online services called hfile service. Developed open-source replacement written in go called quiver. Rewriting in go lowered per process overhead enough to enable a single process per hfile. Wrote orchestration tool to automatically verify and deploy new data from our HDFS cluster. \n\nBuilt delta-service to combine offline data with mongodb. Quiver serves the majority of the data cheaply while mongodb stores write on a short TTL. Engineers use a reimplementation of our ORM rogue. \n\nTeam lead on an experimental key-value store called “Kyiv” to replace our model services. Kyiv is a scala service that stored data in rocksdb. It also uses Kafka as a distributed write log, and aurora/mesos to provide scheduling. Gobblin was used to create rollups from kafka to allow kyiv instances to bootstrap. \nRewrote image resizer service to lower machine costs. After 5 years of running in production, migrated to imgix to reduce overall cost and remove technical debt. \n\nLead initiatives to raise standards around code review, launches, infrastructure changes, and post-mortems. Run a weekly meeting to facilitate cross-team discussion of large code or architectural changes. Member of our on-call rotation.

I've been at Stripe since 2015 where I spent most of my time helping our largest customers and strategic partners build their integrations.  These days I'm excited to use that experience as a developer advocate, helping developers get started on Stripe.

Our team's responsibilities include the borrower loan application, various connector apps for third party integrations, and various lead generation pages. We use Ruby, Clojure, and Javascript. \n\nSome of my team's accomplishments:\n\n- Launched the new borrower loan application under a tight deadline. This application receives most of our borrower traffic, and we were able to launch it without hiccups for new borrowers and give existing borrowers a seamless migration path. See this app here: https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/apply\n- Offboard 2 different consulting teams who were previously working on the project.\n- Launch a new borrower fraud integration with a third party vendor to automate our fraud detection process.\n- Automate third party business report pulls.

16871549,Alex Zylman,Senior Staff Engineer,Senior Staff Engineer at Uber,"Oakland, California, United States","I'm an experienced technical leader. I focus on designing and building scalable, fault-tolerant systems that anticipate the needs of the business.

Currently I'm reporting to the head of commerce, leading efforts across 15+ teams in 5+ countries to unify disparate systems into a cohesive ""Commerce Platform"" to serve complex business requirements across Uber's growing number of product lines.

Previously, I managed 1/3rd of Clever's engineering team, focusing primarily on infrastructure where I built out the Docker-based deployment and observability tooling on AWS. 

Even more previously, I built out Clever's data pipeline and task queue system that ingested roster data, profiled and improved latency in critical services, developed an iOS app that jump-started our growth, and continually kept in mind the needs of our customers.

Whether that's Slack's ""Custom Status"" feature or the external account linking flow at Wealthfront -- I've felt a profound sense of accomplishment when people engage with things I've created.

Before working as a Frontend Engineer at Slack and Wealthfront, I spent eight years at Google as at TPM and in Operations working closely with product and engineering teams.

In 2014, I took a sabbatical from Google to complete Dev Bootcamp and convert my hobbyist's interest in software development into my vocation. I enjoyed researching new technologies, writing clean code, pairing with peers, and performing behavior- and test-driven development.

Previously, I co-founded Chewse to make workplaces better and helped bring it to success — $12M in annual sales, 100+ employees, $15M raised.

A note about my background photo -- from Matt Eggers' LinkedIn profile: Professor Ed Hawkins' warming stripes for 1850 (left side of graphic) to 2018 (right side). Progression from blue (cooler than normal) to red (warmer than normal) annual readings indicates long-term increase of average global temperature. If you're concerned about climate change, consider making this your profile image as well.

Optimized the pipeline for speed to achieve near realtime event processing. \n\nHeaded up design and development of the Kahuna Campaign Engine which allowed customers to message their users at scale while providing them with tools to filter and segment the audience. Iterated on the campaign engine to include personalization in each message on a per user basis. Personalization of user data included simple user attribute information (gender, name, age) to more complex affinity behavior (most recently visited, favorite all time, top 5 liked) based on users entire event history ingested by the data pipeline. Took the campaign engine one step further by designing and implementing the campaign orchestration feature at Kahuna. Orchestrating a series of campaigns to guide our customers users through an experience. Leveraging already built features such as data ingestion, segmentation, and campaign messaging, we were able to keep track of users through a series of steps in our customers products and nudging them toward a customer defined end goal.\n\nAs each feature was developed and tested, I took upon myself to obsess over performance and cost efficiency. Over the course of a quarter I was able to drive down our costs nearly 50%.

Subsequently, I focused on Ruby and application performance work, including a migration from per-merchant-account to per-payment database sharding, re-implementing the Sorbet runtime’s typed struct infrastructure for order-of-magnitude accessor and (de)serialization performance gains, eliminating ~10% of database reads by making the application's in-process cache aware of potentially-relaxed consistency requirements, and writing or rewriting the majority of Stripe’s latency observability tooling for Ruby."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFqiwiSMcKk6A/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1724937022726/stripe_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=2DlHi2OYGRjWYV5_TByDatIWQLEigD0x_lUidoTR00E"",""company_name"":""Stripe""},{""title"":""Senior Engineer"",""end_date"":""2016-07-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2012-10-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Full-stack software development for a 10-25-employee, 35-million-user startup which offers a platform for academics to share research, working primarily in Ruby on Rails on top of PostgreSQL and AWS.

For that matter, I'm pretty happy as I am... but I'm willing to talk about other options near Boulder.  Not so much about things elsewhere.

That out of the way, I'm a senior software engineer, full-stack including JavaScript and Android.  I've held management and leadership jobs, and might interested in returning to that with a local-office environment (which I haven't had in a while, which is why I didn't try to keep that role).  I code in Kotlin, Java, Go, C/C++, Python, Javascript, and other languages.  I'm familiar with many of Google's cloud products, and at least aware of the analogous AWS offerings.  I also know Android, and I'm open to learning iOS but haven't yet had to.

Outside of work, I juggle, I do woodworking (minor cabinetry and home improvement, mostly), and these days I've swapped out playing flute and ultimate for keeping track of teen children and too dang many pets.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fka3profile,,"[{""title"":""Technical Lead"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2018-02-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Started on Square's orders team, adding new features particular for deposit/balance payments to a single order.

Snapchat is a complex “12 mobile apps in 1”, with thousands of back-end servers running across AWS, GCP and on-prem. Each feature wants all the resources of a phone to create the most compelling experience. This means orchestrating concurrent and battery efficient use of network, CPU, GPU, APU, video codecs and camera – much like an OS. Components need clean isolation to avoid corruption or hogging by background features while maximizing the customer’s experience for whatever they are engaging at the moment.\n\nAPI design was not enough to achieve this, so I also led technical ops. The hardest aspect was building our Customer Experience Program (CEPP) that ensured features and platform components achieved performance, battery and metrics accuracy goals. This scaled from app startup latency and messaging reliability to 50 areas and 500 customer-focused “end to end” metrics. I built cross-functional collaborations across eng, design, monetization and finance in several ops programs including CEPP, where we reported and reviewed metrics in weekly leadership forums. I used these to ensure API and service shortfalls were being continuously identified and renovated to meet the demands of new features, growing scale and cost.\n\nLast, I owned key aspects of Eng culture: designing and (co-)authoring the Eng ladder system, roles \\ leveling \\ hiring guidelines, OKR framework, and perf \\ calibration \\ promo process. I built the Eng promo and hiring budget analysis with HR, to ensure a healthy balance of level distributions. I mentored 100 of the senior-most engineers each quarter, and created dedicated challenges to grow top talent into bigger roles."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGS67pnekd_qQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1706902360485/snap_inc_co_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=kkF_ZH0ry2_kPa_rUcxnjJV8h8-MncALwZiqjpN9Oy8"",""company_name"":""Snap Inc.""},{""title"":""VP of Technology, R&D"",""end_date"":""2015-10-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Greater Seattle Area"",""start_date"":""2013-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Founded and managed Activision Seattle studio - an advanced development team which helps title studios explore disruptive technologies and stay ahead of industry trends.

My favorite relationships at Vercel were ones of mutual mentorship.\n\nWhile there, I designed interviews, rebuilt the cache invalidation system, mentored teammates, debugged (and caused, oops) AWS outages, and recruited talented engineers. The net result was that we turned a big ship: thousands of edge servers managed by three engineers on a rickety stack ended up on a much more positive trajectory.\n\nI helped Vercel cross the valley of despair of adding its first real layer of software engineering management, serving as the only internally promoted manager. I worked closely with several others to develop our internal performance evaluation and leveling rubric, and helped land the framework with the engineering team, some of whom had been at the company six+ years.\n\nI genuinely wish I could have cloned myself and stayed for much longer.

I onboarded multiple managers and interviewers into this system.\n· Operationalized data ingestion: Pavilion’s primary dataset initially was scraped from websites. I led improvements on the data ingestion system to the point where we had hundreds of data sources being refreshed monthly, with the ability to stand up multiple data sources per week through a combination of technical infrastructure and reusable scraper components, run by a data operations team in conjunction with software engineers and an outsourced team of scraper writers.\n· Upgraded search: Upgraded Pavilion’s search infrastructure from AWS Cloudsearch to Algolia and eventually to OpenAI vector embedded search. Algolia allowed us to quickly iterate on how our search worked and enabled us to find product-market-fit. As vector-embedded search became more sophisticated and commercially viable, we switched to enable semantic search and improve outcomes on long-tail queries.

23812,Caitlin Colgrove,Co-Founder and CTO,Co-Founder and CTO at Hex,San Francisco Bay Area,"What I love most about being a software engineer is building products that combine the best parts of technological solutions with human expertise to solve problems in the real world. I've built mobile search interfaces for police officers, providing instant access to life-saving information; document analysis and triage applications for lawyers, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the e-discovery process by orders of magnitude; and collaborative, high-scale data analysis tools for the engineers who diagnose and fix critical issues with in-service aircraft.

Though I've spent most of my development time building modern web interfaces, I've also learned that delivering an excellent product requires attention across the entire stack, from the product vision and user experience down to the nuts and bolts of the backend services. I've never been afraid to move up and down the stack to address whatever the most pressing technical challenge is at the time.

Technology is important, but all software teams are also made up of people, which is why I invest a lot of my time in areas like hiring and people growth. I discovered a love of teaching while in college and have continued that pursuit in industry, first through mentorship and later as a people manager for the engineering team I lead. As manager, I've grown people into senior engineers and leads of their own teams – it's been one of the most rewarding aspects of my job.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/colgrove,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/c31b19f3b73eaa81595cddee53e0f8238c2cbe3326178731a278f4116d3a754f.jpg,"[{""title"":""Co-Founder and CTO"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2019-11-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGPSikej9EpbQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1718232346589?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=8G79jIgq2Zxg9CgS3MTdwnS9pUr4MJpXu_RYvFsEHwI"",""company_name"":""Hex""},{""title"":""Director of Engineering"",""end_date"":""2019-11-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2019-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Managed the three teams comprising the Remix data platform: data engineering, data visualization, and data explorer.
