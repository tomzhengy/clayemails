You can try it out at www.paperlesspost.com/flyer\n\nI've also been leading the development team at an org level on adopting a modernized deployment flow for our React applications. While advocating for this change I wrote up a detailed proposal and gave multiple presentations, which included demonstrating working prototypes. Instead of building and deploying our javascript as part of the Rails server deploys, we have moved to a deploy system where we upload versioned static assets to S3 and reference them from the application server. This allows us to preview versions in production before activating them for our customers and dramatically speeds up the time it takes for us to deploy changes.

These “model services” are a system to export mongo’s replication logs to kafka and aggregate the updates in a stateful service to cache joins in redis. \n\nBuilt a read-only key-value store to deliver offline data to our online services called hfile service. Developed open-source replacement written in go called quiver. Rewriting in go lowered per process overhead enough to enable a single process per hfile. Wrote orchestration tool to automatically verify and deploy new data from our HDFS cluster. \n\nBuilt delta-service to combine offline data with mongodb. Quiver serves the majority of the data cheaply while mongodb stores write on a short TTL. Engineers use a reimplementation of our ORM rogue. \n\nTeam lead on an experimental key-value store called “Kyiv” to replace our model services. Kyiv is a scala service that stored data in rocksdb.

Found thousands of significant quality issues.\n\n*\tMigrated Windows Phone from the fixed-length ARM32 instruction set to the variable-length Thumb2 instruction set, requiring numerous changes to drivers, the kernel, the compiler backend, and the debugger.  Reduced code size of OS binaries by 22% overall and reduced average boot time by 6%. Zero functional or performance regressions.\n\n*\tDesigned and implemented an efficient automated test selection system for Windows Phone by mashing up code coverage data and change history.\n\n*\tSecurity Engineer on Windows Mobile.

I wrote initial versions of several subsystems, including the garbage collector, migrated legacy software to use the new database, and disentangled code from the legacy codebase in preparation for open sourcing.\n\nI founded a team to improve developer tooling and continuous integration on the multi-million line legacy Java codebase at the core of the business. Before I started, builds took hours, on carefully maintained dedicated machines. A dev might find out their change had broken a test weeks after the fact, if ever. The product hadn’t been released in a year. Only a few grizzled experts dared touch the build scripts.\n\nWhen I left the team, every build ran on any developer laptop.

I've been at Stripe since 2015 where I spent most of my time helping our largest customers and strategic partners build their integrations.  These days I'm excited to use that experience as a developer advocate, helping developers get started on Stripe.

This new data allowed us to use a new, more predictive risk model in production.\n- Integrate with a third party bank information provider, allowing borrowers to automatically connect to their bank accounts instead of sending us several bank account statements.

16871549,Alex Zylman,Senior Staff Engineer,Senior Staff Engineer at Uber,"Oakland, California, United States","I'm an experienced technical leader. I focus on designing and building scalable, fault-tolerant systems that anticipate the needs of the business.

Currently I'm reporting to the head of commerce, leading efforts across 15+ teams in 5+ countries to unify disparate systems into a cohesive ""Commerce Platform"" to serve complex business requirements across Uber's growing number of product lines.

Previously, I managed 1/3rd of Clever's engineering team, focusing primarily on infrastructure where I built out the Docker-based deployment and observability tooling on AWS. 

Even more previously, I built out Clever's data pipeline and task queue system that ingested roster data, profiled and improved latency in critical services, developed an iOS app that jump-started our growth, and continually kept in mind the needs of our customers.

At Stripe, I led Professional Services in APAC, growing that team from four to over twenty people across the region. I have led teams on many projects deploying and integrating data analytics platforms and payments systems into complicated enterprise stacks.  I like to be hands on and try to get a deep understanding of the problem space and technical solutions whenever possible.

Primary languages are Python (e.g. Spark, Django, Scikit) and JavaScript (e.g. Angular, D3), with some experience in Ruby (Rails) and R.  Cloud deployment and DevOps experience is primarily with Amazon AWS and Google Compute Engine using Ansible.  I've dabbled in Haskell, Node, and Android / Java.

Please do not email me with a cold reachout if:

* Your message is not tailored to me
* The opportunity is at a beak-of-the-vampire-squid finance operation of some sort
* The same as above, but doubled, if it has something to do with some sort of crypto/NFT/blockchain scam-flavor of the week
* You have previously emailed me and I did not reply, to ""bump it up to the top of my inbox""
^ honestly, I probably auto-blocked you after the first email anyway. I'm prone to doing that
* The job is fully remote/distributed. I'm an in-offices person.

Think very hard before emailing a cold reachout if:

At Uber, Submit Queue handles 100s of commits/hr submitted by ~1000 of engineers every day.\n\nIndividual contributions made:\n-- Came up the idea of speculatively executing builds that are mostly likely to succeed to scale the system to 100s of commits/hr.\n-- Designed and implemented a conflict analyzer to detect if two changes are likely to conflict or not using the build system.\n-- Built Machine Learning models that continuously learn & estimate the likelihood of changes to pass builds.\n-- Architected the system to handle 100s of repositories, failover-active in all of Uber's regions.\n-- Published a research paper at Eurosys'19 introducing SubmitQueue and detailing its core components.\n\nuCI - a reliable task execution/orchestration system for stateful workloads:\nLaid the foundation for a world class CI Infrastructure at Uber by replacing Jenkins with a scalable task execution system that leverages mesos for cluster management.\n"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFiYnR1Mbtxdg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630552741617/uber_com_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=FaJ_DOyyJIKIEg3OPew9OPLEfLZ2E3Mc8KiMzwVdZcg"",""company_name"":""Uber""},{""title"":""Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""2016-05-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2016-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Mainly worked on productionizing deep-speech, a speech recognition system trained using deep learning end-to-end."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQHMIhOBxixb_w/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1631348662745?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=iWxYYTWf-db5xXxlSUBA9dTnwKNzwqujyeXGDmPfR6k"",""company_name"":""Baidu USA""},{""title"":""Software Developer"",""end_date"":""2016-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2014-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Software Engineer on Uber's Address Graph Team.

115855722,Andrew Archer,Senior Software Engineer,Senior Software Engineer at Airbnb,"San Diego, California, United States","I love to see people use the things we build.

Whether that's Slack's ""Custom Status"" feature or the external account linking flow at Wealthfront -- I've felt a profound sense of accomplishment when people engage with things I've created.

Before working as a Frontend Engineer at Slack and Wealthfront, I spent eight years at Google as at TPM and in Operations working closely with product and engineering teams.

In 2014, I took a sabbatical from Google to complete Dev Bootcamp and convert my hobbyist's interest in software development into my vocation. I enjoyed researching new technologies, writing clean code, pairing with peers, and performing behavior- and test-driven development.

My mission now is to continue learning, code every day with others, and build software that people love.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarcher,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/e029605b440bf97462294ab0deac6eaa3137b49d571e0a29e7c79125af1631eb.jpg,"[{""title"":""Senior Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco, California"",""start_date"":""2018-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Drive the future of Frontend products in the industry and create world class performance for all of Airbnb’s products\nCollaborate with Product Managers and Experience Designers to iterate on the design and implementation of our product\nWork with Data Scientists and Backend Engineers to build features and ship experiments\nBuild efficient and reusable front-end systems and abstractions\nFind and address performance issues\nParticipate in design and code reviews\nIdentify and communicate front-end best practices"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQFhfl32crIGIw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630637496980/airbnb_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=pMoWyW-Gc2D-iZAnlGFml1r4S6qGtZFELMqGcXYB23s"",""company_name"":""Airbnb""},{""title"":""Frontend Engineer"",""end_date"":""2018-07-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2016-10-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Use extensive knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to improve the Slack web client, a complex in-browser application relied upon by millions of users every day.

A lot of the work to make this happen involved large-scale full-stack redesigns of the app, that among other things, impact the following: how our customers’ data was stored and maintained in our database; how our internal REST API updated the data; and how the data was translated in a declarative way into the end-user and internal UI.\n\nFurther, I built tools and services that impacted our internal customer-facing teams, developed our app's automated integrations with third-party software, and created support for A/B testing end-user features. I also built and maintained our productivity and CI automation tooling, and redeveloped our integration test suite to significantly improve test predictability and coverage. I was a SME when it came to the telemetry and data analysis aspect of our application, esp. on enabling the business to make data-driven decisions.\n\nI was also a source of domain knowledge for a number of areas of our technology and represented engineering as a lead in broader conversations and company leadership meetings."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQErUAS2sTZL7w/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1707950002068/boundless_immigration_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=6FW5h0Pq2vxqrO78sYAL1PRwM3zCjjOst9O7bahUx5g"",""company_name"":""Boundless Immigration""},{""title"":""Staff Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco and Seattle"",""start_date"":""2015-10-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)\nWorked on PCF, an application deployment PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service).

Within a month, the most common customer complaint of\nover 2 years dropped out of the top 10. \n\n•  After fixing an emergency bug related to Cross Site Scripting, I took the initiative to attend training related to security. I documented the learning from that training and went on to train my team on methods to avoid XSS and CSFR, in addition to working with QA to better test for these cases."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHTvZwCx4p2Qg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630640869849/amazon_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=99uTaxqOdtohdgLNrr6RG4e6uSmKLjeGgD6wvEWL9ns"",""company_name"":""Amazon""},{""title"":""Industrial Engineering Manager"",""end_date"":""2016-09-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2010-07-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Lead Industrial and Systems Engineer, Project Manager for Mechanical Process Improvement Strategy Initiative\n\n• Managed a cross functional team that completely redesigned the mechanical manufacturing process by creating a system controlled assembly application. The system went through multiple refinements, based on post implementation analysis of production and defect data. Outcomes included increased throughput, reducing per unit assembly times up to 60%, leading to an average labor savings of 300 worker-hours per month. Furthermore, the process curtailed internally reported defects from an initial 15.4 DPMO to a post implementation rate of 1.6 DPMO. \n\n• Managed a team of Industrial Engineers, across multiple sites, to implement system wide solutions to the stocking and kitting processes. By developing and implementing a standardized material stocking, consolidation, and tracking processes, we were able to reduce kitting and stocking related labor costs by 28 worker hours/day.\n\n• Designed a process specific analysis program, with SQL/VBA, to identify root causes of operational performance gaps and production line shutdowns. Using that data, I programmed and implemented an electronic scheduler to ensure kit production kept proper pace with the assembly lines’ component demands. The average cycle time for kits was reduced by over 10 days per kit, 25% of their aging, while production downtime was reduced by over 10 worker hours/ day. \n\n• Managed overhaul of the Engineering Change Order (ECO) process, designing business requirements, developing the interface for custom applications, and creating key performance indicators. Lead the user acceptance test phase, training, and post-implementation auditing. By eliminating repeated and excessive ECO related meetings, we were able to save an average of 15 engineer/program manager hours per day, reducing average ECO cycle time from 6 weeks down to 2."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEDqSVVQ7PXsQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1736268715444/paramit_corporation_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=sWZcDGMe8JWG46GSt6XrkVGIzZ-3qDv0WZicABGItvA"",""company_name"":""Paramit Corporation""}]","[{""degree"":""M.S.E"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQG_hYM6Fu3qOw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1661269572284/university_of_michigan_college_of_engineering_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=W0_xZ89I8mpdAowTShVRA5P9lEc9L5Bda3CWXoFz8pU"",""school_name"":""University of Michigan College of Engineering"",""field_of_study"":""Industrial and Operations Engineering""},{""degree"":""B.S.E."",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQG_hYM6Fu3qOw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1661269572284/university_of_michigan_college_of_engineering_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=W0_xZ89I8mpdAowTShVRA5P9lEc9L5Bda3CWXoFz8pU"",""school_name"":""University of Michigan College of Engineering"",""field_of_study"":""Industrial and Operations Engineering""}]",Success,amanning@amazon.com,wesleyhardingjohn@gmail.com; wesleyharding.john@gmail.com,+1 484-459-2100; +14087825600,http://www.facebook.com/alex.manning.5245,100,https://twitter.com/zewildkindness,100,,

I developed expertise in device integration including co-inventing the Android Sync Cable (U.S. Patent 9,292,475) which established a full-duplex communication channel over the phone audio port (similar to Square Card Reader) and developing the Glooko MeterSync Cable, which BLE-enabled over 90% of the global market share of glucometers.\n\nBefore I left, I served as the Technical Lead of one of two Android Product teams as well as the Device Integration team. My responsibilities as Technical Lead were to manage the development efforts of two teams of five engineers each including sprint planning, system design of complex features, task estimation and assignment, and review of all code submitted to the Android code base."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFU7zaCnaVsXA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1640102412141/glooko_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=WTYG2R_wsVeItZBgqF5WKofB0fpDF1D9TCebZ02Zf-g"",""company_name"":""Glooko""}]","[{""degree"":""BS"",""end_date"":""2011-01-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""2007-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHr9suxyJBXMw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1635534378870/stanford_university_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=-NqRXOslayfg-4vcK6tABN0cIlM8hvoUuWHrYASMRp8"",""school_name"":""Stanford University"",""field_of_study"":""Computer Science""}]",Success,,mortiz@cs.stanford.edu; mikeorteaseme@gmail.com,+1 650-336-4555; (415) 510-4027; (415) 800-5959; +1 609-645-7822,,,,,,

A note about my background photo -- from Matt Eggers' LinkedIn profile: Professor Ed Hawkins' warming stripes for 1850 (left side of graphic) to 2018 (right side). Progression from blue (cooler than normal) to red (warmer than normal) annual readings indicates long-term increase of average global temperature.

Cloud data warehouse solutions maintain tight control over the systems, which allows data infrastructure teams to ensure proper governance, data integrity, security, and performance. However, these systems often suffer from a lack of flexibility and scale. That's where open source data lake(house) systems come into play. \n\nAt LinkedIn, we self-manage an open source data lakehouse deployment, and we have faced challenges in providing a managed experience for our end-users. Loss of managed experience often means our end-users have to deal with low-level infra concerns, diluting their core product focus. Moreover, our data infra teams are left with little control on the system we operate, making it harder for us to regulate proper governance and optimization.\n\nControl that liberates is a paradoxical idea, where a well implemented control mechanism can actually empower data infra teams to “regain control” so that they can govern better, and liberate end-users from low level infra concerns by providing them a fully managed offering.\n\nOpenHouse is materialization of this idea!"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHaVYd13rRz3A/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1638831590218/linkedin_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=Wa8H5FNWW0EXbItBEV3V6-triqUVxocouEv0F0clV5Q"",""company_name"":""LinkedIn""},{""title"":""Mentor"",""end_date"":""2022-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2021-07-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Volunteering as a Plato Mentor\n\nhttps://www.platohq.com/mentors/sumedh-sakdeo-1711268726"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHwFu1cqrTiWA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1693851993563/platohq_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=ZaDeeHHRG5X6MKWHpANClgNTeTOr48uqIqz484wMJ8M"",""company_name"":""Plato ""},{""title"":""Head of Data, Self Driving Division"",""end_date"":""2021-09-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Palo Alto, California, United States"",""start_date"":""2021-03-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""I led the Data org within Lyft's Self Driving Division, Level-5.

Took the campaign engine one step further by designing and implementing the campaign orchestration feature at Kahuna.

These projects resulted in saving the company multi-million annual dollars in infra costs, reduced service latency and e2e latency by 50-90% for dozens of our clients, and simplified our architecture which lowered operator toil and system complexity.\n- Day-to-day owner of several large-scale low-level distributed online serving and storage systems serving 10+ million QPS, multi-tenant clusters with 100s of datasets at PB scale. Includes: Terrapin (featured in Designing Data Intensive Applications), a distributed open-source key-value NoSQL system built in-house based on HDFS; Rockstore, another C++-based key-value NoSQL system based on the open-source technology Rocksplicator, also built in-house, which uses Apache Helix + Zookeeper for cluster coordination/replication and RocksDB as the low level storage engine; UMS, a read-write KV system which uses HBase; plus other Java and C++-based stateful storage systems with custom aggregation logic/stateless services which include the use of both remote and local cache.\n- Maintain, operate and implement new feature development on both stateless and stateful systems which form critical foundations for almost all of Pinterest engineering (ML, spam detection, user-facing features, core data)"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFiwsk1pTWN1g/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1713892956828/pinterest_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=oFmcF7CIn6NDq8SItX1YYFMKz27Kxs-3UTi_9SgQCSU"",""company_name"":""Pinterest""},{""title"":""Senior Software Engineer, Web Performance Tech Lead"",""end_date"":""2018-12-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2017-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Tech lead, responsible for Pinterest Web performance and all dependent downstream services (full stack).

For that matter, I'm pretty happy as I am... but I'm willing to talk about other options near Boulder.  Not so much about things elsewhere.

That out of the way, I'm a senior software engineer, full-stack including JavaScript and Android.  I've held management and leadership jobs, and might interested in returning to that with a local-office environment (which I haven't had in a while, which is why I didn't try to keep that role).  I code in Kotlin, Java, Go, C/C++, Python, Javascript, and other languages.  I'm familiar with many of Google's cloud products, and at least aware of the analogous AWS offerings.  I also know Android, and I'm open to learning iOS but haven't yet had to.

Outside of work, I juggle, I do woodworking (minor cabinetry and home improvement, mostly), and these days I've swapped out playing flute and ultimate for keeping track of teen children and too dang many pets.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/fka3profile,,"[{""title"":""Technical Lead"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2018-02-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Started on Square's orders team, adding new features particular for deposit/balance payments to a single order.

Snapchat is a complex “12 mobile apps in 1”, with thousands of back-end servers running across AWS, GCP and on-prem. Each feature wants all the resources of a phone to create the most compelling experience. This means orchestrating concurrent and battery efficient use of network, CPU, GPU, APU, video codecs and camera – much like an OS. Components need clean isolation to avoid corruption or hogging by background features while maximizing the customer’s experience for whatever they are engaging at the moment.\n\nAPI design was not enough to achieve this, so I also led technical ops. The hardest aspect was building our Customer Experience Program (CEPP) that ensured features and platform components achieved performance, battery and metrics accuracy goals. This scaled from app startup latency and messaging reliability to 50 areas and 500 customer-focused “end to end” metrics. I built cross-functional collaborations across eng, design, monetization and finance in several ops programs including CEPP, where we reported and reviewed metrics in weekly leadership forums. I used these to ensure API and service shortfalls were being continuously identified and renovated to meet the demands of new features, growing scale and cost.\n\nLast, I owned key aspects of Eng culture: designing and (co-)authoring the Eng ladder system, roles \\ leveling \\ hiring guidelines, OKR framework, and perf \\ calibration \\ promo process. I built the Eng promo and hiring budget analysis with HR, to ensure a healthy balance of level distributions.

As my last large project at Dropbox, I worked on rebuilding and fully rewriting our metrics collection and querying systems. As part of this project, I also helped build out our observability/monitoring team in NYC. Project turned out quite well overall, some highlights:\n- New system finally allowed us to collect and query all sorts of metrics, including percentile breakdowns even for our largest scale systems. \n- New system was ~2x cheaper compared to what it replaced (and orders of magnitude cheaper compared to external paid offerings), while at the same time providing more features, more granularity, and much better latencies from collecting a metric to seeing it show up on graphs."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHjnNsmL5L2NA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1654114493492/dropbox_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=evN6WnOoNoe_tx-XRy05THGdmBJgNW-9m2AUuyk-mJo"",""company_name"":""Dropbox""},{""title"":""Principal Engineer"",""end_date"":""2019-03-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2014-11-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""In ~2014 we built out and grew our infrastructure to run in multiple regions (we called it \""multi homing\""), and we also set on a path to have more consistent \""hybrid infrastructure\"" setup where systems in our own data-centers and systems in AWS would become more consistent and easier to manage together. I was heavily involved in a lot of the projects to facilitate this:\n- Worked on multi homing our internal machine database and service discovery systems. As part of this project, also worked with others to standardize our infrastructure topology and created shared understandable standard between our Software, Network and Datacenters teams. \n- Did a lot of the initial designs of how to multi home all our other services, including Databases/Edgestore\n\nSometime in 2015, I moved to NYC. \n- Helped build our first infrastructure team in NYC. By the time I left in 2019, infra presence in NYC had grown to ~4-5 core teams and a lot of great engineers.\n- Worked on various projects during this time, mostly to grow the team in NYC. As port of these projects built out a new type of testing framework that allowed us to write and run integration tests in controlled repeatable environments. While we ended up replacing the system few years later, all of its core ideas remained intact and we drastically improved integration testing abilities for our infra services. \n\nIn 2016-2017, I spent a lot of time on performance. As the culmination of all the perf work, I worked on building new distributed in-memory hash table system that replaced all our Memcache deployments. \n- This new system was fully written in GO, and had 99 percentile latencies in single digit milliseconds.\n- Rewriting this system allowed us to finally fix a lot hacky workarounds for our consistency protocols, and in addition to improving correctness guarantees, it opened up new paths for our multi homing related projects in databases."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHjnNsmL5L2NA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1654114493492/dropbox_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=evN6WnOoNoe_tx-XRy05THGdmBJgNW-9m2AUuyk-mJo"",""company_name"":""Dropbox""},{""title"":""Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""2014-11-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2011-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Joined DBX as 4th (or 5th?) engineer on infrastructure team.\n- Initially spent time working on our EC2/AWS infrastructure parts. But as all other members of the team, I was also heavily involved in our very high paced operations and fire fighting during our exponential growth phase.\n- Built out our first Hadoop/HDFS/HBase setup and built our internal logging systems and libraries. Also rebuilt our server application exception and error reporting system, which remained in use (for better or worse, but mostly worse) at least until 2019.\n\nSometime in 2012-2013 switched to working on our databases. Built Edgestore, a distributed database, that over the years became defacto metadata storage for all of DBX, storing all metadata except for file journaling information in it. As part of this project, I also helped bring many changes to all of infrastructure:\n- With few others, pioneered use of GoLang at DBX, and built a lot of the internal core libraries in it.\n- Started moving our infrastructure towards service oriented architecture. As part of that effort, built first versions of our packaging and deployment systems and also our service discovery system that was integrated into our RPC framework.\n\nOverall these projects turned out quite well: Edgestore grew as the main metadata storage system at DBX, GO became our main language for building infra services, and we successfully moved into service oriented setup for all our infrastructure."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHjnNsmL5L2NA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1654114493492/dropbox_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=evN6WnOoNoe_tx-XRy05THGdmBJgNW-9m2AUuyk-mJo"",""company_name"":""Dropbox""},{""title"":""Software Engineer - Intern"",""end_date"":""2010-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":"""",""start_date"":""2010-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Worked with Google Front End server team as a Software Engineer Intern.

2737784,Cosmo Q.,Venture Fellow,Engineering @Airbnb,"San Francisco, California, United States","With over 10 years in software engineering, I've been building multi-tier platforms at Airbnb, enhancing platform resilience, and driving quality and growth metrics. My passion extends beyond professional work including leading open-source projects (Lepton, which has been highlighted by Ubuntu, with 11k stars) and being technical reviews of upcoming tech books. 

I'm happy with my current work but open for TL roles if there are complex challenges with scaling product platforms. I am a very hands-on person who enjoys coding, documenting, mentoring and collaborating extensively.

66006925,Karen thomas,Technical Director,Technical Director,"New York, New York, United States","Online marketing mode and offline marketing mode is opposed to each other but interdependent. On the one hand, the emergence of e-commerce platforms has impacted the development of the real economy, and nowadays, many consumers tend to shop online conveniently and cheaply, which leads to the declining sales of offline stores and the shrinking of the real economy to a certain extent; on the other hand, the real economy is an important foundation of a country's economy, and if the real economy cannot develop healthily, the virtual economy will also be affected to a greater extent. At the same time, the recovery and development of the real economy will certainly also seize the market and sales of the online platform, affecting the development of e-commerce platform. The contradiction between online marketing mode and offline marketing mode determines that it is difficult for the real economy and the virtual economy to survive and develop independently, and only by combining with each other can we achieve a win-win situation.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-thomas-9b397824a,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/af6bf39b85dc610cab41f78d8ffda8d3c95c113926956d6a7d89a66ee0f38d40.jpg,"[{""title"":""Technical Director"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""United States"",""start_date"":""2014-03-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""We are primarily a software and services company, known for our big data analytics, with our main clients being government agencies and financial institutions.\nDevelop complex custom analytics using scripting, workflow or menu-driven functionality Integration with executables in R, Python and DOS to support the development of efficient, unified analyses"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFj435hYi7p1A/company-logo_400_400/B4EZXS7uMcHcAY-/0/1743000626250/palantir_technologies_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=BPGXbkR1EI6yla_Mh-cSJXT_ryypWnjnmYn4zt7i50g"",""company_name"":""Palantir Technologies""},{""title"":""Project Manager"",""end_date"":""2012-12-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""United States"",""start_date"":""2011-10-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Responsible for the development, maintenance and improvement of the project, participate in architecture design, technical research, write architecture design documents, outline and detailed design documents, deliver software modules and systems on time and with high quality, ensure the efficient operation of the team, complete the implementation of functional business code according to the design documents, requirements, system prototypes, maintain efficient communication with the business, product, testing and operation and maintenance teams to ensure the project efficient progress Cooperate with software development project manager to achieve related tasks and objectives"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF0hQrvoqdRNw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1725894960637/delltechnologies_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=w9B_GrB6E5koNcnvw9_YmMI20CjbqJqLMiX-CbiaKzQ"",""company_name"":""Dell Technologies""},{""title"":""Java Architect"",""end_date"":""2011-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Beijing, China"",""start_date"":""2010-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""To be who you want to be, To do what you want to do"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQEKtpNWRRh5aQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630645356849/hulu_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=Bh1X_0OLygM78Ea5N_5aWnci1Hi1vm4iGiwah4q7skk"",""company_name"":""Hulu""},{""title"":""Software Architect"",""end_date"":""2010-04-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""United States"",""start_date"":""2009-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""In-depth discovery and analysis of business requirements, write technical solutions and system design, participate in technical solutions and system design reviews, grasp the design of complex systems, ensure the quality of the system architecture, the core part of the system code writing, problem solving, cross-team, department to promote key core projects, follow up on the project progress, promote the project implementation, and pay attention to project data and results, the existing or future system for macro Thinking about existing or future systems, planning to form a unified framework, platform or components, guiding and training engineers, helping team members to grow together, introducing innovative technologies and solutions for the team, solving problems with innovative ideas, continuously optimizing the system through architecture, and improving the product experience"",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF0hQrvoqdRNw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1725894960637/delltechnologies_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=w9B_GrB6E5koNcnvw9_YmMI20CjbqJqLMiX-CbiaKzQ"",""company_name"":""Dell Technologies""},{""title"":""Programmer"",""end_date"":""2009-07-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Beijing, China"",""start_date"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""We strive to make a positive impact on the world based on a culture of transparency, ethics, integrity, equality and inclusion, and working hand-in-hand with our ecosystem partners.

Curiosity led me to pursue work in cloud infrastructure, and I leveled up dramatically on the domain while at Vercel. My favorite relationships at Vercel were ones of mutual mentorship.\n\nWhile there, I designed interviews, rebuilt the cache invalidation system, mentored teammates, debugged (and caused, oops) AWS outages, and recruited talented engineers. The net result was that we turned a big ship: thousands of edge servers managed by three engineers on a rickety stack ended up on a much more positive trajectory.\n\nI helped Vercel cross the valley of despair of adding its first real layer of software engineering management, serving as the only internally promoted manager. I worked closely with several others to develop our internal performance evaluation and leveling rubric, and helped land the framework with the engineering team, some of whom had been at the company six+ years.\n\nI genuinely wish I could have cloned myself and stayed for much longer.

Our work delivered the same quality of tools that we as software engineers used every day to the discipline of data engineering, when open source only solved the tip of the iceberg. One user told us: \""I've been waiting 20 years for a product like yours.\""\n\nI wore many other hats: navigating technical customer work in France and Japan, bringing the Gotham platform to the modern era by building HTTP APIs, pushing the limits of the deployability and cloud infrastructure tools that would become Palantir Apollo, and mentoring and managing interns and young engineers.  Rotating into the Forward Deployed Engineer role gave me invaluable technical operational\nchops, and leading a \""tri-coastal\"" development team during Foundry's infancy taught me how to keep a dozen plates spinning during an earthquake.\n\nI learned so much at Palantir and will forever be grateful for the investment the company made in me and the mentorship received and relationships formed."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFj435hYi7p1A/company-logo_400_400/B4EZXS7uMcHcAY-/0/1743000626250/palantir_technologies_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=BPGXbkR1EI6yla_Mh-cSJXT_ryypWnjnmYn4zt7i50g"",""company_name"":""Palantir Technologies""},{""title"":""Software Engineer Intern"",""end_date"":""2012-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Palo Alto, CA"",""start_date"":""2012-05-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFj435hYi7p1A/company-logo_400_400/B4EZXS7uMcHcAY-/0/1743000626250/palantir_technologies_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=BPGXbkR1EI6yla_Mh-cSJXT_ryypWnjnmYn4zt7i50g"",""company_name"":""Palantir Technologies""},{""title"":""Software Engineer Intern"",""end_date"":""2011-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Cambridge, MA"",""start_date"":""2011-06-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHiNSL4Or29cg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1631311446380?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=uv0EuX5IZOtTWHdryJ_FWq7YK_NY2Zz-vmyjHKc7EQQ"",""company_name"":""Google""},{""title"":""Software Engineer Intern"",""end_date"":""2010-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Seattle, WA"",""start_date"":""2010-05-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHTvZwCx4p2Qg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630640869849/amazon_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=99uTaxqOdtohdgLNrr6RG4e6uSmKLjeGgD6wvEWL9ns"",""company_name"":""Amazon""}]","[{""degree"":""Bachelor of Science"",""end_date"":""2013-01-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""2009-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH-UXRfIDIKug/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1689799729035/mit_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=xxIWgx_iLSRkJNzo6b30uB7tlYstJIUVZn0i0pgtQFs"",""school_name"":""Massachusetts Institute of Technology"",""field_of_study"":""Computer Science, Theoretical Math""}]",Success,jhoch@fioreandsons.com; jason.hoch@newfrontinsurance.com,jrshoch@gmail.com; jasondhoch@gmail.com,(415) 754-3635; +1 303-429-8893; +1 775-388-3350; (203) 482-0837,http://www.facebook.com/jrshoch,100,https://www.twitter.com/jrshoch,100,,

115730838,Peter Leeds,Principle Software Engineer,Software Engineer at Meta,"Menlo Park, California, United States","I believe that computer programming can change the world for the better.  With every passing day people become more and more overwhelmed by choices in their lives and in the marketplace.  Algorithms have the potential to help people deal with and overcome decision fatigue.  This is what I do.  I write code to make decisions for people.  

People don't need to make decisions anymore.  Most people don't want to.  I firmly believe that most people can't really be trusted to make decisions for themselves.  The companies that I partner with are better equipped to make informed purchasing and life decisions than their customers and users.  I help them do this.  It is a profound responsibility to design human choice, but I am willing to pick up this mantle and ride forth  into the brave new world where we plan the future  for all mankind.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwleeds,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/fe8714d39de097c055abe3715e5d928d2c5a8de0db6cda42b3d5a65245ca30b7.jpg,"[{""title"":""Principle Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Menlo Park, California, United States"",""start_date"":""2022-05-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFdNatYGiBelg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1636138754252/facebook_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=c3ZuiKKiAbsvDLj2f3gg2046JR8ziPY5EZu9g-INQUA"",""company_name"":""Meta""},{""title"":""Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""2022-04-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Seattle, Washington, United States"",""start_date"":""2019-02-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFiYnR1Mbtxdg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630552741617/uber_com_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=FaJ_DOyyJIKIEg3OPew9OPLEfLZ2E3Mc8KiMzwVdZcg"",""company_name"":""Uber""},{""title"":""Software Developer"",""end_date"":""2015-05-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Santa Clara, California, United States"",""start_date"":""2010-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHiNSL4Or29cg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1631311446380?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=uv0EuX5IZOtTWHdryJ_FWq7YK_NY2Zz-vmyjHKc7EQQ"",""company_name"":""Google""},{""title"":""Software Developer"",""end_date"":""2009-02-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Kirkland, Washington, United States"",""start_date"":""2007-09-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH32RJQCl3dDQ/company-logo_400_400/B56ZYQ0mrGGoAc-/0/1744038948046/microsoft_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=NxRk-eP0-CtXw-AOT1vRVCOYD_8qolMPNdUFkPTRdBA"",""company_name"":""Microsoft""},{""title"":""Software Developer"",""end_date"":""2006-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Redmond, Washington, United States"",""start_date"":""2001-11-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630637844948/apple_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=GPwG8Zu18g8LmqsT2Jb--CQqcjj2uDeVJruYEkscLqo"",""company_name"":""Apple""}]","[{""degree"":""Master's degree"",""end_date"":""2000-01-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""1997-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH-UXRfIDIKug/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1689799729035/mit_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=xxIWgx_iLSRkJNzo6b30uB7tlYstJIUVZn0i0pgtQFs"",""school_name"":""Massachusetts Institute of Technology"",""field_of_study"":""Computer Science""},{""degree"":""Bachelor's degree"",""end_date"":""1997-05-01T00:00:00"",""start_date"":""1994-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""school_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHnnnIo0U9EsA/company-logo_400_400/B4EZXIJKuOHgAY-/0/1742819601734/university_of_cambridge_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=YjzJy09q8nVwUyCoixVDKZQT-O8zWN-v3vGa9xVordo"",""school_name"":""University of Cambridge"",""field_of_study"":""Computer Science""}]",No contacts found,,,,,,,,,

Contribute and coordinate in environments with lots of interesting technologies and

23812,Caitlin Colgrove,Co-Founder and CTO,Co-Founder and CTO at Hex,San Francisco Bay Area,"What I love most about being a software engineer is building products that combine the best parts of technological solutions with human expertise to solve problems in the real world. I've built mobile search interfaces for police officers, providing instant access to life-saving information; document analysis and triage applications for lawyers, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the e-discovery process by orders of magnitude; and collaborative, high-scale data analysis tools for the engineers who diagnose and fix critical issues with in-service aircraft.

Though I've spent most of my development time building modern web interfaces, I've also learned that delivering an excellent product requires attention across the entire stack, from the product vision and user experience down to the nuts and bolts of the backend services. I've never been afraid to move up and down the stack to address whatever the most pressing technical challenge is at the time.

Technology is important, but all software teams are also made up of people, which is why I invest a lot of my time in areas like hiring and people growth. I discovered a love of teaching while in college and have continued that pursuit in industry, first through mentorship and later as a people manager for the engineering team I lead. As manager, I've grown people into senior engineers and leads of their own teams – it's been one of the most rewarding aspects of my job.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/colgrove,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/c31b19f3b73eaa81595cddee53e0f8238c2cbe3326178731a278f4116d3a754f.jpg,"[{""title"":""Co-Founder and CTO"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2019-11-01T00:00:00"",""description"":"""",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGPSikej9EpbQ/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1718232346589?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=8G79jIgq2Zxg9CgS3MTdwnS9pUr4MJpXu_RYvFsEHwI"",""company_name"":""Hex""},{""title"":""Director of Engineering"",""end_date"":""2019-11-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2019-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Managed the three teams comprising the Remix data platform: data engineering, data visualization, and data explorer.

Particularly proud of our efforts to build CodeExchange (twilio.com/code-exchange) from the ground up. CodeExchange is a low-code solutions repository that reduces the barrier to entry and value for developers and non-technical builders.
