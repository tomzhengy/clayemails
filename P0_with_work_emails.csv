Data Labeling allows customers to annotate image and text data with labels for use in developing custom Machine Learning models.  This product had around 500 active monthly customers who label a combined average of two million datapoints per month and supported some of Azure Machine Learning’s largest customers.  Within this project I developed a novel method for using large language models like GPT4 to automatically label both text and image data without the need for any pre-training.\n\nI developed the first version of Azure Arc-enabled Machine Learning, though Public Preview.  This product supports customers who want to use Azure’s machine learning tools in highly-controlled compute environments, including within their on-premises data centers, with no loss of features or ease of use.\n\nI built Azure ML Reinforcement Learning through Public Preview.  This feature enabled data scientists to use a range of reinforcement learning techniques at high-scale, leveraging the Ray/RLLib platform.

Other skills include Javascript, CSS, and the Django web framework, C, and SQL, HTML and CGI, and knowledge of C++ and Java as well.

I've developed for MySQL and PostgreSQL (Postgres).

Specialties: Test automation frameworks, at multiple employers.  Design and implementation of dynamically generated web pages (frameworks and CGI).

Good use of existing Perl and Python libraries. I'd rather search for a solution than write it myself.

3983780,Yang Liu,Senior Staff Software Engineer,Senior Staff Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, California, United States","I am a ML software engineer at Meta. I am passionate about applying various cutting edge machine learning technologies (supervised learning, reinforcement learning, NLP, large language model) to solve the real-world optimization problems. I prototype and lead building the following company-wide multi-tenant optimization solutions in production:

- Who: the viewer understanding 
- To whom: the audience and segment understanding 
- When: the product delivery time optimization 
- Where: the product delivery surface optimization 
- How often: the product delivery frequency optimization
- Internationalization: the product localization optimization 
- GenAI personalization 

Prior to joining Facebook/Meta, I have extensive experience in life science and I discovered autosis (a novel form of programmed cell death which occurs in various human diseases) at UT Southwest Medical Center in 2011.

I am currently responsible for KMS’ evolution into public EC2 infrastructure and cell-based architecture strategies to remove scalability limitations and meet the increasing demand for key management solutions at scale in the cloud.\n\nMy contributions allowed for the delivery of the following:\n\nAutomation of KMS host provisioning and secret management process. We reduced hundreds of engineer/hours per year spent on host and fleet management. This automation support removed the need for engineers to access hosts and enforce hands off secret management strategies for fleets that contain the most sensitive secret material in AWS!\n\nMigration of KMS fleets into public EC2 infrastructure. KMS is provisioned onto EC2’s virtualization infrastructure using the same enhanced security features that are offered to our customers. The performance gained from this has allowed us to see measurable improvements in KMS' data plane API latency by as much as 50%!  \n\nFormal verification mechanisms to assert the correctness and completeness of customer managed keys during its life cycle. KMS continually audits and verifies mutations against its data stores to assert all actions are in accordance with customer intent. This provides confidence against any loss or corruption of a key that would otherwise result in a denial of service to any data encrypted under this key!\n\nThe introduction of new Hardware Security Module (HSM) vendors and management systems as KMS expanded its presence into regions with different government regulations and requirements on encryption technologies. This allowed us to maintain customer trust in KMS across all regions while meeting government requirements that vary per region."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE0fp2sCqnVLg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1738855736997/amazon_web_services_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=PXat5kkzgOArPcu2mz9NJ5bbXfS7Mu1I4WSYmf9TTEs"",""company_name"":""Amazon Web Services (AWS)""},{""title"":""Software Development Engineer"",""end_date"":""2017-07-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Greater Seattle Area"",""start_date"":""2015-08-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Full Stack Software Engineer for Amazon's Identity Services group within the eCommerce Platform.

This allowed us to consolidate and improve the customer experience for many challenge based workflows, including One Time Passcode (OTP), customer account questions, captcha, password verification. \n\nMy contributions allowed for the delivery of the following:\n\n1. The rapid development of customer facing security workflows with reusable UI components that could be composed dynamically into different contexts.\n\n2. An improved password reset experience with OTP-based workflows for all Amazon customers; significantly improving not just the security of these workflow, but also increased sales due to higher rate of successful logins.\n\n3.

3984838,Bill Schaller,Senior Staff Software Engineer,Senior Staff Software Engineer at Meta,"New York, New York, United States","At Meta, I've spent the past 6 years working in the area of efficiency and performance.

I've spent most of the past 4 years saving Meta an average of $86M per year on compute costs via direct optimization work on our web service. I've also taught countless engineers at the company to do this work themselves. I love saving compute!

For the first few years at Meta, I worked on performance visualization and tracing tools. While that work was rewarding, my passion was always directed towards the performance and efficiency work those tools unlocked.

In my previous work at ZeroedIn, I worked on the company's data visualization and analysis platform as the lead engineer. This was full-stack work.

During my employment, I had the opportunity to spend 3 months training and building expertise in Front End Development with instructors and mentors that were top in their fields. After Yahoo, I decided to move to NYC to take a new job as a frontend engineer with Meetup. During this time was when I discovered my second passion, fitness and Crossfit. I started coaching and training a few hours each week while working full time as a Product Engineering Lead & Manager at Meetup. After 4 awesome years at Meetup, I decided in late 2015 to become a part-time consultant for Meetup and freelance a few other small projects, all the while learning and getting certified and training more in fitness as well.

I feel very fortunate that I have been able to work in both tech and fitness for these past several years! I'm looking for my next opportunity and excited to see what the future holds!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadafs,,"[{""title"":""Senior Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Los Angeles, California, United States"",""start_date"":""2021-04-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Frontend Developer on the Production Apps UI Team."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGMva5_E8pUjw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1736276678240/netflix_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=7ocZF3qK0iCZU8_yMnWA2_VSLNR99ZVfxdoNiMXKlbY"",""company_name"":""Netflix""},{""title"":""Crossfit Trainer"",""end_date"":""2020-04-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Greater Los Angeles Area"",""start_date"":""2019-01-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""A member of the coaching staff at StrengthRx Crossfit."",""company_logo"":"""",""company_name"":""StrengthRx CrossFit""},{""title"":""Frontend Engineer // Web Developer"",""end_date"":""2019-11-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""(Remote)"",""start_date"":""2015-12-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""- Founding member of Meetup’s “Web Platform” team tasked to investigate, plan, and\nimplement a new web application platform for Meetup.\n- Iteratively developed and delivered a NodeJS + Hapi Web Server based React +\nRedux + Webpack SPA that solved complex problems including authentication,\nrouting, security (CSRF), and offered many tools for web performance, translation &\ninternationalization, and a shared component library.\n- Implemented, and supported the web applications CI/CD pipeline using TravisCI.\n- Worked directly with the Senior Web Performance engineer to plan and develop a\nlibrary that captures RUM data using JS User Timing API.\nhttps://github.com/ux-capture/ux-capture\n- Rolled the platform out to all development teams for 100% adoption and provided\ncontinual support, training, and delivery of new feature sets.\nhttps://github.com/meetup/meetup-web-platform\n- Provided supplemental support migrating the application from Google App Engine\nto AWS Fargate.

158756327,Roy Shea,Senior Software Engineer,Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft,"Redmond, Washington, United States","Roy Shea spent the first three decades of his life enjoying academia. During this time he obtained his BSc in Math and Computer Science from Harvey Mudd, and his MSc and Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA with research focused on diagnosing faults in wireless and embedded systems.

Roy loves creating and working with beautiful software systems, and has a passion for testing and measuring these systems.  His expertise revolves around deconstructing complex systems into simple units that can be validated and evaluated in isolation, and with end-to-end evaluation of complete systems to demonstrate expected behavior and monitor performance changes over time.  He combines product goals with insights gained from evaluation and performance monitoring to refine the focus of engineering efforts.

Roy has long been interested in better ways to teach introductory Computer Science and he can occasionally be found as a volunteer educator.  Roy spent a number of years working as an outdoors guide and often contemplates when he'll be back in the mountains.  In off hours Roy pursues a love of Chinese teas and well made espresso, a hobby that has led to his acting as a formal taster for both tea vendors and artisan coffee roasters.

Build System Auto-healing: \nBuilt a system to configure auto-healing for failed build steps for Dynamics CRM. At the time, builds would run for many hours to generate CRM product and symbols for 55 languages. There wasnt a way to configure retry policy on individual steps, which resulted in entire builds being restarted. I customized Microsoft's internal tool  - Buildtracker to be able to configure auto healing for build steps, such as retry, queue on a different machine, terminate early and an able to plugin custom healing steps : send an email to the component owner etc. The impact of this project was high\n- Build engineers in the team didn't have to wake up and retry/restart builds to meet timelines\n- Improved time to complete builds \n2. Reduce Deployment time for CRM\nParallelized several steps and contributed to the internal AutoBoss system to run efficient test automations.

B.S. Electrical Engineering Computer Science, Minor Mathematics. UC Berkeley -- Class of 2013.

I have a strong foundation in data structures and problem solving, and I am extremely interested in problems involving optimization and design.  I have an obsession with self-sustaining, automatic, and futuristic processes, and I strongly believe in simplistic interfaces for an enhanced user experience.

I see computer science as an art form with numerous isomorphic structures to real life. Many mundane, repetitive tasks in life now can be modeled and optimized through the power of code.

115933052,James Gill,"Software Engineer, Spatial Computing",Polymath,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","I design, architect, and build robust systems to solve interesting problems. I work the whole stack, from CSS to SQL, from product direction to cluster infrastructure, from server to client, from UI to API. I believe you should build only what you need, but build it well. I consider testing to be part of development, not something to add-on later. I've found that doing it right at first pays dividends for a long time to come.

I enjoy working in small, nimble groups that value flexibility over process. I don't like ""throwing things over the wall""; people can have valuable input along the whole process. I think job titles are a convenience, not a goal.

Our major challenge was scaling the system to support the predicted growth in ad volume. This involved making the automatic system more intelligent such that it detected similarities between ads and could apply decisions made on one component of an ad to a similar component on another ad. It also involved working with our manual review teams in Austin, Texas and Hyderabad, India to surface useful information in their manual review tools that would make them more efficient.\n\nPayments Risk - I worked on the system that analyzes every payment made on Facebook for ads, games, and peer-to-peer to detect and action on fraudulent activity. This involved making the system more extensible so we could support the unique needs of every payment product. I also supported manual review teams who reviewed and reversed payments by building their manual review systems and pipelines.\n \nMobile Speed - I worked on building mobile performance tools. Most notably, I worked on a project called Loom that recorded performance trace data from production giving our product teams real insight into scenarios where their product is demonstrating slow performance. I focused on making the system dynamic so we could record traces for different scenarios based on server-side configurations. I also had the privilege of presenting Loom at Facebook's Perf@Scale and F8 conferences.\n\nMorphing Framework - Flexible tool used by all engineers at the company to traverse datastores safely and completely so they may facilitate cleanup of data for privacy commitments and other needs."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFdNatYGiBelg/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1636138754252/facebook_logo?e=1756944000&v=beta&t=c3ZuiKKiAbsvDLj2f3gg2046JR8ziPY5EZu9g-INQUA"",""company_name"":""Meta""},{""title"":""Software Engineering Intern"",""end_date"":""2011-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""San Francisco Bay Area"",""start_date"":""2011-04-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""I built the UI that allows people who use our mobile site, iPhone application, and Android application to interact with polls.

This work involved updating call patterns as millions of SQL queries were replaced with HTTP REST calls and performing phased rollouts to ensure the service could handle the new load. As these services rolled out, I was responsible for noting and making recommendations on architectural changes such as conversion of MySQL tables to DynamoDB and the addition of Cloudsearch indices.\n\nPrior to my work on microservices, I was involved with the signals team which transformed into the data science team as the work became more theme driven rather than being tied to a specific feature. During my time on that team we transformed a feature that used a hand spun heuristic based method of detection to a data driven SVM. This involved setting up my first microservice which leveraged scikit-learn and nltk. I helped our data scientists take the first steps into a more modern pipeline for training SVMs by introducing a tool that allowed distributed people to perform labeling operations and store the results in a centralized database. I also helped them version their scripts to share updates with each other. These shared scripts were updated to produce a rich model that included all metadata, model parameters, etc needed to use the models in the new production service without manual code changes."",""company_logo"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQG4Le_upfM1WA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1722545382144/hearsay_systems_logo?e=1756339200&v=beta&t=mlockj1xdAHDsz3Laa4n3K8ob9927zKHBrX3hJnkCm4"",""company_name"":""Hearsay Systems""},{""title"":""Software Developer"",""end_date"":""2014-08-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Arlington, VA"",""start_date"":""2013-04-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""I supported the company's core product, iSpatial.

Companies internal systems relied on 3 different mechanisms of auth. We built a service layer on the top to manage access and permissions across these 3 mechanisms. The goal was to set a direction for future efforts in unifying the 3 mechanisms. The challenges here were collecting 18-20 different use cases from different internal teams and designing the API.\n\n- Designed and developed application to generate canned reports giving information about an advertising campaign across multiple dimensions (demographics, geography and interests). These reports were generated using Map reduce jobs and stored in HBase using AWS EMR. The query response time was expected to be sub seconds.  \n\n- I lead a team of 6 developers to build an analytics service that powered ~20TB of big data. The goal was to enable marketers to run ad-hoc queries on their campaigns. Eg. For my 15 campaign, how many users were male, based out of Seattle, between the ages of 24-35, liked Game of Thrones, and were in the market for Ford. The number of segments in a query can change and the response should be in sub milliseconds. We evaluated multiple different technologies like AWS EMR, AWS Aurora, AWS Redshift and Apache Druid.

I like tackling puzzles in software development & maintenance, and solving them in ways that are unlikely to fail, or if they must fail, fail gracefully.

As a researcher, I'm interested in the design and implementation of programming languages, especially functional languages, the development of language abstractions to make programming easier, more powerful and more robust; I'm also interested in distributed computing, its algorithms and its theory.

3142839,Arun Swami,Principal Staff Software Engineer,Technical Leadership ♦ Solve Business Problems With Insights from Big Data Derived Using High Performance Algorithms,"Cupertino, California, United States","I love solving hard problems that lead to personal learning and growth. A key theme of my career is solving business and technical problems using large data and machine learning.

♦  Work with business leaders to identify problems, map the problems to appropriate technologies, and often led the effort to build the solutions. This can be seen in my work as Chief Data Scientist at Dtex Systems, as the CTO at Digital Jones, and as the co-founder and CTO at Neta.

♦  Keep on top of evolving technologies and use them as needed to build solutions. I not only lead the effort but also build significant parts of the solutions.

♦  Advise start ups and VC firms. VC firms have used me for technical due diligence on prospective investments. For example, serve as technical advisor to startups like iHealthFrontier (an ACO infrastructure and analytics company).

LINKEDIN: Created a novel data validation system (Data Sentinel). Led a cross-organizational team to build and launch a company-wide data validation service.

DTEX SYSTEMS: Provided thought leadership on using Data Science in Dtex's products. Standardized analysis on  the Scala/Spark platform. Designed and implemented a risk scoring application that brought processing times down by a factor of 100. The platform that I built for storing analytic data is used in multiple applications.

DIGITAL JONES: Led the development of a knowledge base and inference algorithm that allowed us to build 10x more product guides.

NETA: Co-founded, built technology, presented to customers and investors, led the due diligence for the acquisition by Infoseek.

INTERNET PROFILES: Built a new version of the Web log analysis system that resulted in a 10x speed up with a 5x decrease in memory usage.

SGI: Designed and implemented key pieces of MineSet (one of the first data mining and visualization products).

I have worked with Scala, Spark, Java, Python, and R using data processing and analytics on multiple projects and business applications.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunswami,https://crustdata-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/person/ee6e4c7bcb6cc75ebe63ea56352a1df97cc649e2930847f0108c0e108ad2510e.jpg,"[{""title"":""Principal Staff Software Engineer"",""end_date"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00"",""location"":""Sunnyvale, California"",""start_date"":""2016-09-01T00:00:00"",""description"":""Started inLabs initiative to improve documentation for engineers.

The SmartPath platform runs on any cloud or bare metal infrastructure that supports Linux and offers the ability to migrate across IAAS providers and offers monitoring, log aggregation, process healing and automated scale.\n\n•\tAs a Senior Consultant my responsibilities vary across projects. I have been a Technical Architect and Team Lead for a variety of start up companies. In this capacity I have defined infrastructural requirements (IAAS Providers, infrastructural assets like load balancers, servers,  storage, etc.), led network, logical and process diagraming and led infrastructural development, managing small teams of developers (usually 3 or less). These environments have been built, primarily, on node.js, run on the SmartPath Platform and heavily utilize document-oriented database technologies (MongoDB and CouchDB).  \n\n•\tI have also served as a Senior Integrations Consultant, most recently for Mohegan Sun, where I have architected and engineered orchestrations, built predominantly atop Mule ESB, that integrate autonomous sub-systems of a given infrastructure. These sub-systems have ranged from services that support their own APIs to proprietary RPG applications, where screen scrapping was required in order to share valuable data. \n\n•\tI served as Front-End Architect for various start-up companies.

In one quarter successfully reduced the number of critical alerts the Twitter Observability Stack fired by 50%\n\nMetric Ingestion Service: Rewrote significant portions of the metric ingestion service to be more reliable, support multiple zones in one cluster, and run in Mesos/Aurora (previously static hosts).

Shipped platform products and backend systems that generate millions in revenue and saved millions in infrastructure and developer productivity costs, across firms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Yieldstreet.

• At Bloomberg, I led the backend/frontend design of MARS risk products that generated $2.1M+ in annual recurring revenue, and built C++ libraries that reduced development time by >80%.
• At AWS (Anti-DDOS & FinTech), I architected core components in Network Firewall and performance-optimized services with Intel DPDK, enhancing mitigation capabilities.
• At Microsoft Teams, I improved multi-threading and responsiveness across desktop clients used by millions globally, while mentoring engineers across product lines.
• I’ve consulted independently via Eizaide Corp, migrating legacy platforms to cloud-native stacks and running AI/ML image generation workloads using RTX 4090 and AMD 7900XTX infrastructure.

Technically, I specialize in distributed systems, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), low-level performance tuning, and infra scaling. Languages include C++, Python, Rust, Go, and TypeScript, with deep cloud fluency in Terraform, Kubernetes, Kafka, and Linux systems programming.

I began the MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon (Tepper + SCS) before withdrawing to pursue hands-on engineering full-time. My background uniquely combines software architecture, financial systems, and platform thinking.

Now seeking full-time roles in NYC or Jersey City, with openness to Seattle or Silicon Valley for the right offer.

115728130,Dayan Paez,Senior Software Development Engineer,Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon,Greater Boston,"In my experience, the best developers are unafraid to learn, and invite the challenge of what's new. In software development, where new is norm, it's critical to keep a curious eye and an open mind.

These days, I am most fascinated by the process of streamlining software delivery. Often, this work is about enacting best practices in an existing environment, which is a challenge that often requires surgical precision. It's about migration without disruption. Changing attitudes and evolving beyond what is customary. And it's about questioning the status quo in pursuit of something better.
