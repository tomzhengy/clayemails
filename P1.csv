158991483,Jamie Shark,Greater Chicago Area,Senior Software Engineer at GitHub,"I'm a trans, non-binary engineer currently working in the tech industry. I care a lot about an engaging user experience that delights both the people building the experience and those that interact with it. I like thinking about how we can make things scalable and reusable, whether or not we are reinventing the wheel or if we need a wheel at all, and asking myself the question, ""Do you want to be right, or do you want resolution?"" I spend a lot of time missing Choco Tacos, turning coffee into code, and herding kittens. I give the talk ""CSS VS. My Gender: A Study in Transitions"" or talk about how I help develop front-end frameworks. I am motivated by learning and study everything I can about my surroundings in order to solve problems effectively and succinctly. I thrive on being challenged to achieve new goals and calculating all the possible ways I can carry out a favor for a friend. I aim to foster a collaborative environment and build a flourishing working space.

59930501,Souptik Sen,"San Francisco, California, United States",Distributed systems | Databases | Cloud Computing,"Areas of Interest: Database internals, Stream processing, Distributed Systems, Data mining. Deriving insights and intelligence from massive datasets has been a privilege to the select few, starting from the Distributed system experts at Google in early 2000s, gradually opening up to strong SWEs in 2010s with popularization of Hadoop/ Spark, and now to SQL programmers with the advent of cloud data warehouse systems. If you squint your eyes hard enough, this closely resembles the personal computer revolution - people were expected to be OS experts to operate a machine as powerful as an iPhone in 1970s! My mission is to build systems that will democratize the power of data to every human being on this planet. And I am deeply interested in any problem that will advance this mission. I work in the Data Infrastructure team at Snowflake where we are building the foundational platform that enables Snowflake to learn faster and better from data. Previously I was working at LinkedIn on a multi-PB scale data computation platform that powered mission-critical systems such as targeting, machine learning experimentation and core data science. At CMU, I focused on Distributed systems, Databases and Machine Learning. I was a Research Assistant at the Parallel Data Lab, working on Distributed ML training under Prof. Gauri Joshi, and assisted Prof Jian Ma for the Algorithms class in CS department. Apart from strong CS fundamentals, I have a good understanding of database internals (built systems on top of Spark and Snowflake query engines), stream processing (worked on the platform that powers nearline data processing for LinkedIn’s time sensitive data needs), web applications (built data tools that make life of LinkedIn data scientists easier) and data mining (strong in SQL programming, took graduate classes on Data mining and Machine learning at CMU/Stanford). I am constantly working on upgrading my skills in relevant areas, through challenging projects at Snowflake, reading and discussing VLDB/ SIGMOD papers and taking advanced Stanford CS classes. I have 2 patents at the USPTO. On the personal front things that interest me are problem solving (Topcoder/ ACM ICPC problems), math (probability and statistics), economics and physics.",Distributed systems | Databases | Cloud Computing,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/souptik-sen-bb0b1619,"[{""title"": ""Software Engineer"", ""end_date"": """", ""location"": ""San Mateo, California, United States"", ""is_current"": true, ""start_date"": ""2020-10"", ""description"": ""Building the foundational Data Infrastructure systems that power billing, governance, machine learning and data science at Snowflake."", ""company_logo"": """", ""company_name"": ""Snowflake"", ""employer_name"": ""Snowflake"", ""employee_title"": ""Software Engineer"", ""employee_location"": ""San Mateo, California, United States"", ""employer_logo_url"": """", ""employee_description"": ""Building the foundational Data Infrastructure systems that power billing, governance, machine learning and data science at Snowflake."", ""employee_position_id"": """", ""employer_company_ids"": [], ""employer_linkedin_id"": """", ""employer_linkedin_description"": ""Software Development ['computers electronics and technology > programming and developer software', 'data warehousing', 'cloud', 'analytics', 'data lake', 'marketing analytics', 'data applications', 'data engineering', 'data science', 'data exchange', 'technology', 'application-software', 'cloud-storage', 'data-management', 'data-storage', 'machine-learning', 'artificial intelligence (ai)', 'cloud data services', 'data management', 'enterprise software', 'software']"", ""employer_company_website_domains"": []}, {""title"": ""Software Engineer 2 (ca Tech)"", ""end_date"": ""2016-05"", ""location"": ""Hyderabad Area, India"", ""is_current"": false, ""start_date"": ""2015-06"", ""description"": ""A highly scalable, reliable distributed workload engine that supports dynamic event- driven scheduling of job streams, with built-in forecasting and simulation. \u2022 Multithreaded Event processor: Achieved 4X Scheduler performance by parallelizing it to ingest multiple streams of event data.

19347385,Tushar Thole,San Francisco Bay Area,Head of Applications engineering at StarTree,"I am a seasoned engineering leader with expertise in monetizing innovation for open-core and infrastructure products in the B2B space. I have almost 20 years of experience at high-growth startups (StarTree, Confluent) and large yet innovative organizations (VMware, C-DAC).   As an infrastructure nerd, I have built and shipped products across diverse domains like Storage, Security, Networking, Cloud Native, Data Streaming, Data Governance, Real-Time Analytics, and Anomaly/Fraud Detection. I hold three patents in Security and Cloud Native Storage. I excel at taking initiatives from 0 to 1, launching transformative products, and driving real business value. I have a proven track record of building high-performing, diverse, and inclusive engineering teams. I have scaled infrastructure, backend, frontend, and full-stack teams across North America, LATAM, EMEA, and APAC. My experience spans the entire software lifecycle, including Engineering, Product Strategy, Marketing, Evangelism, M&A, and Partnerships. As a book worm, I find inspiration for my leadership approach in these timeless quotes: - ""In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few."" - Shunryu Suzuki - ""Begin with the end in mind.” - Stephen R. Covey - ""Stay hungry. Stay foolish."" - Steve Jobs - ""I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" - Maya Angelou - ""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."" - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry",Head of Applications engineering at StarTree,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharthole,"[{""title"": ""Head Of Applications Engineering"", ""end_date"": """", ""location"": ""Mountain View, California, United States"", ""is_current"": true, ""start_date"": ""2022-12"", ""description"": ""Founded by the original creators of Apache Pinot, StarTree is pioneering the user-facing analytics revolution.
